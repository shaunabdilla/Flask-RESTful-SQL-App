# Flask-RESTful-SQL-App
 A simple application using Flask within Python that loads databases from a local file(PracticalTask-Accounts.xlsx) into a RESTful application integrated with SQLite3.
 
 Main server file server.py loads up dbcreate.py to initialise db (locally as CompanyAccounts.db), then loads up routes and interface for app use. Templates for pages in Templates folder.
